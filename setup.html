To install OpenRefine you simply unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a &quot;local&quot; drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.</p>
<p>If you are downloading OpenRefine for Mac, you a re downloading a ‘dmg’ (disk image) file which you can open, and then drag the OpenRefine application to an appropriate folder on you computer.</p>
<p>OpenRefine is a java application, and you need to have a ‘java runtime environment’ (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from http://java.com by going to the site and clicking ‘Free Java Download’.</p>
<p>To run Refine:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Windows: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine and either double-click ‘google-refine.exe’ (for Google Refine 2.5), ’openrefine.exe’ (for OpenRefine 2.6) or ‘refine.bat’ (for either)</li>
